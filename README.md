## What this is

This is a living, community-maintained directory of NZ groups working in
open data, civic tech, climate tech, accessibility, Māori data sovereignty,
humanitarian response, and more. Each entry is a short, plain-language
description with links, verified against a live source.

It's for people looking for NZ tech-for-good groups to work with, volunteer
with, or learn from. It's also for anyone mapping out who's doing what in
this space.

"Tech-for-good" here means technology used for a public benefit:
not-for-profit, government, community, or mission-led work, rather than
purely commercial products. Aotearoa New Zealand only.

## Browse it now

**[Browse the live website](https://olitreadwell.github.io/nz-tech-for-good/)**: searchable, filter by
domain, region, or tag, with a page for every organisation and ecosystem
diagrams. Deploys are manual: `cd apps/web && vercel --prod` (see `docs/deploy.md`). Pushes never deploy on their own.

**[Or read the full directory in GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md)**: every entry, grouped
by domain, with a short description, region, links, tags, and diagrams
showing how entries connect to each other.

### A couple of example entries

**data.govt.nz** (Open Data): the New Zealand government's central website
for finding and downloading open datasets published by government agencies,
covering topics like health, education, transport, and the environment.

**DigitalNZ** (Open Data): run by the National Library of New Zealand, a
search service and open API that brings together more than 30 million
digitised items from over 200 NZ museums, libraries, and archives into one
searchable place.

searchable, filterable site.

## Add an organisation / contribute

Know a group that should be listed? There are two ways to add one, no
coding needed for the first:

1. **[Suggest an entry](../../issues/new?template=add-entry.yml)**: fill in
   a short issue form with what you know. Someone will verify it and add it.
2. **Open a pull request**: copy `data/entry.template.yaml` to
   `data/entries/<slug>.yaml`, fill it in, and submit. Full steps are in
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Every entry must be verified against a live source before it's added.
**Never invent a fact**: leave a field empty rather than guess.

## Use the data

The raw data lives in [`data/entries/`](data/entries/): one YAML file per
entry, shaped by [`schema/entry.schema.json`](schema/entry.schema.json).
[`GUIDE.md`](GUIDE.md) is generated from these files, so if you want the
structured version for your own tooling (a search index, a map, etc.), read
the YAML directly.

- **Code** (scripts, schema, tooling) is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).
- **Data** (the directory entries) is
  [CC-BY-SA-4.0 licensed](LICENSE-DATA.md): reuse and share it, including
  commercially, as long as you credit this project and share alike.

### Machine-readable data

If you'd rather not parse YAML, the whole directory is also exported as
[`data/exports/entries.json`](data/exports/entries.json) (one JSON object
per entry) and [`data/exports/entries.csv`](data/exports/entries.csv) (the
same data flattened to columns), both regenerated from `data/entries/` by
`scripts/export.py` and kept in sync by CI.

## How it's maintained

- Links are checked automatically every week
  ([`.github/workflows/linkcheck.yml`](.github/workflows/linkcheck.yml)); a
  tracking issue opens on genuine dead links and closes when they recover.
- Every entry website is archived to the Wayback Machine every week
  ([`.github/workflows/wayback.yml`](.github/workflows/wayback.yml)); the
  snapshot URLs are recorded in `data/archives.json`.
- `GUIDE.md` is regenerated from the YAML entries, so it's always in sync
  with the underlying data. CI fails a PR if it's out of date.
- Accuracy comes first: every entry is verified against a live source, and
  nothing is invented. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rules.
- This directory lists **public professional information only**. It does
  not currently list any named people: see
  [docs/known-gaps.md](docs/known-gaps.md) for why, and how to help close
  that gap.

## For developers

Clone the repo and set up the scripts used to validate and regenerate the
directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/olitreadwell/nz-tech-for-good.git
cd nz-tech-for-good
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 scripts/validate.py      # check entries against the schema
python3 scripts/build_guide.py   # regenerate GUIDE.md from data/entries/
python3 scripts/linkcheck.py     # optional: check all links for dead ones
python3 scripts/archive_wayback.py --dry-run  # preview Wayback archives
```

Run both `validate.py` and `build_guide.py` after adding or editing an
entry, and commit the regenerated `GUIDE.md`. CI fails a PR if it's out of
date. Full contribution steps, including commit message style, are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How it started

This directory started as a research project by [Oli Treadwell](https://github.com/olitreadwell),
built with AI-assisted research and human verification of every entry. It's
now open for the community to correct, extend, and maintain.

## People and privacy

If you're listed here and want your information corrected or removed,
please [open an issue](../../issues/new) and we'll action it. This takes
priority over completeness.
