"""Export data/entries/*.yaml as machine-readable JSON and CSV.

Reads every YAML file in data/entries/ and writes:
  - data/exports/entries.json: the full entry list, one JSON object per
    entry, sorted by name.
  - data/exports/entries.csv: the same data flattened to columns, with
    list fields (tags, related_to, linkedin_people) joined into a single
    cell.

Every entry is written with the same fixed field order (matching
schema/entry.schema.json), regardless of key order in the source YAML, so
both outputs are byte-for-byte reproducible across runs. Safe to re-run any
time an entry is added or changed.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/export.py
