"""Voice/style checks for this repo's prose. See docs/STYLE.md for the rules.

Checks two things, both fatal on any hit:

  EM DASHES
    - Any "—" character in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/*.md, GUIDE.md,
      or an entry's `what:` field.

  BANNED WORDS
    - Any word from the list below, matched case-insensitively as a whole
      word, in the same files/field.

This only checks prose surfaces, not code comments, YAML field names, or
non-`what:` entry fields (e.g. `source`, which is a verification note, not
voice-governed prose). docs/STYLE.md is excluded: it has to name the banned
words to document them. An entry's own `name` can legitimately contain an
em dash if that's how the organisation styles its real title (e.g. "Code for
America — Brigade Network"); that's a fact, not prose, so known
entry names are stripped out of a line before it's checked.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/stylecheck.py
